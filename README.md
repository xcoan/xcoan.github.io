This is my github pages website, built as a replacement for [this repository](http://www.github.com/xjcoan/mysite).

## Credits
The live background effect is thanks to Vincent Garreau's [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js).

I constructed my logo using [Canva](https://canva.com).

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and
[FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) are also used.
